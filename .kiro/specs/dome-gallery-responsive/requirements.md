# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the responsive behavior of the DomeGallery component, specifically focusing on improving how opened images adapt to different device screen sizes and orientations. The improvements will ensure optimal viewing experiences across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Glossary

- **DomeGallery_Component**: The existing interactive 3D gallery component that displays images in a dome-like arrangement
- **Opened_Image**: The enlarged view of an image when a user clicks on a gallery tile
- **Viewport_System**: The browser's visible area and its dimensions
- **Responsive_Engine**: The system responsible for calculating and applying responsive sizing based on device characteristics
- **Device_Context**: Information about the user's device including screen size, orientation, and input method

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want opened images to automatically resize to fit my screen optimally, so that I can view the full image without scrolling or having it cut off.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens an image on a mobile device, THE Responsive_Engine SHALL calculate optimal dimensions based on the Viewport_System
2. THE DomeGallery_Component SHALL apply maximum width and height constraints that respect device safe areas
3. THE Opened_Image SHALL maintain its aspect ratio while fitting within the available viewport
4. THE DomeGallery_Component SHALL account for device orientation changes and resize accordingly
5. THE Opened_Image SHALL leave appropriate padding around edges for touch interaction

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a tablet user, I want opened images to take advantage of my larger screen while remaining appropriately sized, so that I can enjoy high-quality image viewing without the image being too small or overwhelmingly large.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Responsive_Engine SHALL detect tablet viewport dimensions and apply tablet-specific sizing rules
2. WHEN the Device_Context indicates a tablet, THE DomeGallery_Component SHALL use larger maximum dimensions than mobile
3. THE Opened_Image SHALL scale proportionally to utilize available screen real estate effectively
4. THE DomeGallery_Component SHALL handle both portrait and landscape tablet orientations
5. THE Responsive_Engine SHALL provide smooth transitions when orientation changes occur

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a desktop user, I want opened images to be sized appropriately for my large screen, so that I can see fine details while the image doesn't become pixelated or uncomfortably large.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Responsive_Engine SHALL calculate desktop-appropriate dimensions based on viewport size
2. THE DomeGallery_Component SHALL implement maximum size limits to prevent images from becoming too large on very wide screens
3. THE Opened_Image SHALL maintain crisp quality at larger sizes through appropriate scaling algorithms
4. THE DomeGallery_Component SHALL center images appropriately within the available space
5. THE Responsive_Engine SHALL account for different desktop screen ratios and resolutions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user switching between devices or rotating my device, I want the gallery to adapt smoothly to size changes, so that my viewing experience remains consistent and pleasant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Viewport_System dimensions change, THE Responsive_Engine SHALL recalculate optimal image sizing
2. THE DomeGallery_Component SHALL apply size changes with smooth animations during transitions
3. THE Opened_Image SHALL remain centered and properly positioned during resize operations
4. THE Responsive_Engine SHALL debounce resize events to prevent excessive recalculations
5. THE DomeGallery_Component SHALL maintain the opened state during orientation or window size changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer integrating the DomeGallery, I want configurable responsive behavior options, so that I can customize the gallery's responsive behavior for different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE DomeGallery_Component SHALL accept responsive configuration props for different breakpoints
2. THE Responsive_Engine SHALL allow custom sizing functions for different device types
3. THE DomeGallery_Component SHALL provide default responsive behavior that works well out of the box
4. THE Responsive_Engine SHALL expose hooks for custom responsive logic integration
5. THE DomeGallery_Component SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing prop configurations
