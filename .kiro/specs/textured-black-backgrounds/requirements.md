# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the visual design of the application by replacing flat black backgrounds with textured, organic backgrounds that maintain the AMOLED-optimized aesthetic while adding depth and visual interest. The focus is on the navigation component and other black background elements throughout the application.

## Glossary

- **Navigation Component**: The sticky header component containing the site logo, menu items, and navigation controls
- **Glass Morphism**: A design style using semi-transparent backgrounds with backdrop blur effects
- **AMOLED Display**: A display technology that shows true blacks by turning off pixels, making dark themes more energy-efficient and visually striking
- **Texture Overlay**: A subtle repeating pattern or noise applied over backgrounds to add depth and prevent flat appearance
- **Organic Texture**: Natural, non-geometric patterns that create visual interest without being distracting

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the website, I want the navigation bar to have a textured background instead of a flat black, so that the interface feels more organic and visually engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads, THE Navigation Component SHALL display a subtle organic texture overlay on its black background
2. WHILE the user scrolls the page, THE Navigation Component SHALL maintain the textured background with consistent visual quality
3. THE Navigation Component SHALL preserve its existing glass morphism effects including backdrop blur and border styling
4. THE Navigation Component SHALL maintain AMOLED optimization with deep blacks as the base color
5. THE texture overlay SHALL have an opacity between 0.03 and 0.08 to ensure subtlety

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want textured backgrounds to be consistent across different sections of the site, so that the design feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE application SHALL provide reusable texture patterns that can be applied to any black background element
2. WHERE a component uses a black or dark background, THE application SHALL support optional texture overlay application
3. THE texture patterns SHALL be optimized for performance with appropriate file sizes and formats
4. THE texture SHALL be seamlessly tileable to avoid visible repetition patterns
5. THE application SHALL maintain existing background gradient and overlay effects when textures are applied

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want texture application to be configurable through CSS utilities or component props, so that I can easily apply textures to new components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE application SHALL provide CSS utility classes for applying textured backgrounds
2. THE SectionBackground component SHALL accept a texture configuration option for black backgrounds
3. THE texture system SHALL allow customization of opacity, blend mode, and pattern type
4. THE implementation SHALL not break existing styling or component functionality
5. THE texture utilities SHALL be documented with usage examples

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the textured backgrounds to look good on both desktop and mobile screens, so that I have a consistent experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE textured backgrounds SHALL render correctly on viewport widths from 320px to 2560px
2. THE texture patterns SHALL scale appropriately without pixelation on high-DPI displays
3. THE performance impact of texture overlays SHALL not cause frame rate drops below 60fps on modern devices
4. WHEN the device has limited resources, THE application SHALL maintain acceptable performance with textured backgrounds
